Our instructor encouraged us to put this project on our github. This project was the first time touching C# for me. Most of the class chose to do the project in Python, our previous classes language, but we chose .NET because of how popular it is with companies. Since I knew how to use Firebase from mobile app dev, and since I was eager to get the project done early, I implemented Firebase and got all the basic mechanics done myself. After that, we went back through it together to style it and make it look like a real application.

If I had known the C# package for firebase was as restricted as it is, I would've used a relational database instead of the realtime database. I did waste a lot of data pushing an entire list of objects every time instead of just pushing the new ones (but the package pushes a list of objects with the index as the key, and pushing just the last 3 objects would result in the data stored in 0, 1 and 2 to be overwritten). But it wouldn't have been fair to my partner to change the database type halfway through, and it did work for a project this size. I did learn an important lesson about the limits of certain packages, and how JSON is treated differently accross different languages.
